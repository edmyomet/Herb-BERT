Volatile oil of types II, III and IV—major constituent is usually beta- asarone (isoasarone), up to %. In- dian calamus oil contains asarone up to % and its beta-isomer. In type I, beta-asarone and other phenylpropa- noids are absent. It is superior in spas- molytic activity to the other types. Indian practitioners mostly use  A. calamus  externally. Shveta Vachaa (Haimavati, equated with  Acorus gra- mineus  Scoland. Ex Ait., a diploid, is used internally. Unani physicians use Paris polyphylla  Sim. as Khuraasaani Bach. The essential oil-free alcoholic ex- tract of  A. calamus  possesses sedative and analgesic properties. Alpha-asarone potentiates pento- barbital, accounts for some, but not all, neurodepressive activity. Beta-asarone is reportedly hallucinogenic. (Francis Brinker.) The ethanolic extract of rhizomes show signiﬁcant antisecretory and an- tiulcerogenic activity; also, protective eﬀect against cytodestructive agents, experimentally.",

Arecanut tannins (.–.%) are predominantly catechol tannins which closely resemble Mimosa bark tan- nins. Powdered nuts are prescribed in diarrhoea and urinary disorders. In combination with other astringent and styptic herbs, arecanut is used as a ma- jor constituent in confections of Indian medicine for gynaecological disorders. Aqueous extract of the nut exhibits direct vasoconstriction and adrenaline potentiation in rats. Antimicrobial activity is due to polyphenolic frac- tion. Tannins potentiated the action of acetylcholine in ileum and uterus of rat and noradrenaline on seminal vesicle at low concentration.

These saline qualities are mainly responsible for the wholesome invigorating properties of Borage. Borage imparts pleasant ﬂavour and cooling eﬀect to beverages. In India, squashes and syrups, sold during sum- mer, contain Borage extract. Borage contains ascorbic acid (mg/g). Flowers contain cholin, glucose, fructose, amino acids, tan- nin (about %). Seeds contain protein (.%) and an oil (.%). The seed oil is one of the important sources of gamma-linoleic acid and linoleic acid. Borage oil, combined with Evening Primrose oil, is used in hypercholes- terolaemia. Borage seed oil is used for rheuma- toid arthritis, atopic eczema, infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis, neurodermati- tis, also for PMS and for preventing heart disease and stroke. Only UPA (unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids) free oil is given internally. Listed by  German Commission E among unapproved herbs. It hasbeen suggestedthat boragenot be used with drugs known to lower the seizure threshold such as tricyclic an- tidepressants and phenothiazines due to GLA content (only borage seed oil contains signiﬁcant amounts of GLA).

Key application    Extracts orally to treat stress-induced stomach and duodenal ulcers; topically to accelerate healing, particularly in cases of chronic postsurgical and post trauma wounds; also to treat second and third degree burns. Patients suﬀering from venous insuﬃciency were treated with a titrated extract of the drug. ( WHO. ) Used in Indian medicine as a brain tonic and sedative. ( Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia. ) Major constituents of the plant are: triterpenoid saponins—brahmoside, asiaticoside, thankuniside; alkaloids (hydrocotyline); bitter principles (vel- larin). Brahmoside, present in the plant, is reported to exhibit tranquilizing and anabolic activity. Raw leaves are eaten or plant decoction is drunk to treat hypertension. Asiaticoside, extracted from leaves, gave encouraging results in leprosy. It dissolves the waxy covering of  Bacil- lus leprae.  Centelloside has also been found useful in leprosy. Asiaticoside reduced the number tubercular lesions in the liver, lungs, nerve ganglia and spleen in experimental animals. An- other derivative of asiaticoside, oxyasi- aticoside, inhibits growth of  Tubercle bacillus ataconcentrationof.ml/ml Asiaticosides are also hyperglycaemic. The asiatic acid acts against resis- tant bacteria, particularly  Mycobacteri- um tuberculosis  and  M. leprae  as well as Gram-positive cocci. Asiaticosides elevate blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol levels. They seem to decrease blood urea nitrogen and acid phosphatase lev- els. (Pharmacological ﬁndings.

The bark contains tannin identiﬁed as mixed type of proanthocyanidin. The fruit contains superoxide dis- mutase .units/g fresh weight and exhibits antisenescent (anti-aging) ac- tivity. Fruit, juice, its sediment and residue are antioxidant due to gal- lic acid. EtOH (%) extract—anti- viral. Aqueous extract of the fruit increas- es cardiac glycogen level and decreases serum GOT, GPT and LDH in rats hav- ing induced myocardial necrosis. Preliminary evidence suggests that the fruit and its juice may lower serum cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and phospholipids without aﬀecting HDL levels and may have positive eﬀect on atherosclerosis.

( German Commission E, ESCOP, WHO. ) As vasoactive and platelet aggregation inhibitor. ( The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia .) (For pharmocological studies in humans and clinical studies, see ESCOP .) The majority of pharmacological studies and clinical trials have been conduced using a standardized extract which contains % ﬂavonoid glyco- sides (Ginko ﬂavone glycosides) and % terpenoids (ginkgolides and bilob- alide). The extract increases tolerance to hypoxia and exhibits anti-ischaemic eﬀect. It simultaneously improves the ﬂuidity of blood, decreases platelet ad- hesion, decreases platelet and erythro- cyte aggregation and reduces plasma and blood viscosity. The extract pro- tects erythrocytes from haemolysis. The extract also decreases the perme- ability of capillaries and protects the cell membrane by trapping deleterious free radicals. The extract also increased cerebral blood ﬂow in about % patients eval- uated (patients between –year age had % increase from the base line, compared with % in those - to - year-olds).

Root and fruit—antiparalytic. Leaf—juice is used in hiccough (emetic in high doses); cooked leaves are given in inﬂuenza and catarrhal aﬀections. Root-bark—antivi- ral, anti-inﬂammatory, analgesic. Bark—antifungal, antibacterial. Stem-bark and ﬂower—hypo- glycaemic. Seeds—an infusion, anti-inﬂammatory, antispasmodic and diuretic; given in venereal diseases. Along with other therapeutic appli- cations,  The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India  indicated the use of the dried root bark in goitre, glycosuria and lipid disorders (also dried seeds), and leaf, seed, root bark and stem bark in inter- nal abscess, piles and ﬁstula-in-ano. The plant contains antibacterial principles, spirochin and pterygosper- min which are eﬀective against both Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative bacteria. The leaves contain nitrile glycosides, niazirin and niazirinin and mustard oil glycosides. The mustard oil glycosides showed hypotensive, bradycardiac ef- fects and spasmolytic activity, justify- ing theuse of leaves for gastrointestinal motility disorders. The roots possessantibacterial, anti- choleric and antiviral properties due to the presence of pterygospermin, Spiro chin and benzylisothiocyanate. The root extract exhibited signiﬁcant anti- inﬂammatory activity in carrageenan- induced paw-oedema in rats. The leaves exhibited hypoglycaemic activity, although the plasma insulin level did not alter much. The root and bark showed antifer- tility activity through biphasic action on the duration of the estrous cycle of female rats.",

The alkaloid harman has been iso- lated, but the presence of harmine, har- maline, harmol and harmalol has been disputed. The alkaloid and ﬂavonoids are reported to have sedative activity in animals. Apigenin exhibits antispas- modic and anti-inﬂammatory activity. Passion Flower was formerly ap- proved as an OTC sedative in the USA, but it was taken oﬀthe market in  because safety and eﬀectiveness had not been proven. An animal study in suggested that apigenin binds to central benzodi-zepine receptors (pos- sibly causing anxiolytic eﬀects). ( Natu- ral Medicines Comprehensive Database, .) The drug is used in homoeopathic medicine for epilepsy. The herb exhibits a motility-inhi- biting eﬀect in animal experiments.

A large amount of Dopa, mainly in free state and partly in the form of its beta- glucoside; and gluco alkaloids, vicine and convicine, have been isolated. Ingestion of fresh, uncooked or par- tially cooked beans is not recommend- ed. The seeds gave positive test for hy- drocyanic acid and also contain ar- senic. The fresh beans exhibit an oestro- genic activity. Phytoalexins of the im- mature seeds exhibit antifungal acti- vity.
